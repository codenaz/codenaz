### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am Patrick, currently building software for firmatek cloud. My current job is helping me explore technologies around maps, images and geolocations.

- I am currently learning swift so I can do more native developement. It's a pretty awesome language

- Give my open source packages([React Paginator](https://github.com/codenaz/react-paginator) and [React multi image upload](https://github.com/codenaz/react-multiple-image-input)) a try, you might love them. ðŸ˜„

- Reach me on patricknwak@gmail.com or contact me through my [portfolio](https://emeka.dev)
